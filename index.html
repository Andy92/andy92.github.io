				<h3>About me</h3>
				<p>Hello!</p>
				<p>I am Andy and I am passionate about unique and complex problemsolving as well as IT security. An ideal work environment for me would involve constant challenges which I would approach within a team with like-minded people. What I love about working in teams is the exchange of ideas and critical thinking as well as the social aspect such as playing cards or grabbing a beer. 
						<br><br>
				In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my girlfriend, hacking CTF challenges, bug bounty hunting, nurturing my plants and working on random home electronic projects.
